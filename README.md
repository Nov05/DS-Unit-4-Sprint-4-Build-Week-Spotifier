## Project   

**PROJECT NAME**  
Spotify Song Suggester

**PITCH**   
Build an app to enable users to browse and visualize audio features of over 116k spotify songs.

MVP: User can search for a specific song and see its audio features displayed in a visually appealing way. The app also identifies songs with similar audio features.

Stretch goal: The app hits the Spotify API to enable the user to search for any song on the platform.

**MVP**  
DS:     
- Build a model to recommend songs based on similarity to user input (I like song x, here are n songs like it based on these similar features)  
- Create visualizations using song data to highlight similarities and differences between recommendations.  

**Web:**  
- user registration/login flow  
- User can save their favorite songs to their profile in the Web backend
- Once the user has their favorites saved the DS API can make suggestions based on the audio features of their favorites.
- User can request suggested songs based on what they are in the mood for ( acousticness, danceability, duration, energy, etc)
- User can edit and delete their favorites.  

**STRETCH**  
DS:
- Create animations of your visualizations
- Highlight commonalities across the X most popular songs in the dataset

Web:
- When the user has a large number of favorites, find a way to visualize the audio features the user likes the most in an attractive way.
